## TapAndConfigure demo
This sample app demonstrates how to configure a Link-OS BlueTooth printer using the PrintConnect app. A font file, ALVANIA.TTF and the configuration file, config.txt stored on the /sdcard will be read and sent towards the printer via the BT link.
To make this sample app to work, the PrintConnect app needs to be installed on your Zebra Device.
PrintConnect app can be found on Google Play Store at: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zebra.printconnect&hl=nl&gl=US
